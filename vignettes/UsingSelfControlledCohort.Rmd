The Self Controlled Cohort method measures the association between an
exposure and an outcome by comparing the number of outcomes during an
unexposed time at risk to the number of outcomes during an exposed time
at risk. The method is called "Self-Controlled" because each individual
in the study contributes person-time to both the exposed and unexposed
cohorts. Since each person contributes both exposed and unexposed time
to the study only persons who experience the exposure can be used. The
inputs to the analysis are the exposures and outcomes of interest, the
unexposed time at risk and exposed time at risk dates for each person,
and various analysis parameter settings that will be discussed in more
detail.

There are seven time points to consider when defining this analysis.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
# library(DiagrammeR)

sequenceDiagram
  participant Tn100 as Observation Period Start
  participant Tn30 as Unexposed Risk Window Start
  participant Tn1 as Unexposed Risk Window End
  participant T0 as Exposure Start Date (Time 0)
  participant T1 as Exposed Risk Window Start
  participant T30 as Exposed Risk Window End
  participant T100 as Observation Period End

  Tn100 ->> T0: washout period
  T0 ->> T100: followup period
  Tn30->>Tn1: Unexposed time at risk
  T1->>T30: Exposed time at risk
")
```

For each exposure-outcome pair the following statistics are calculated:

-   Number of persons with the exposure

-   Total number of exposures (A person can experience the exposure
    multiple times.)

-   Number of outcomes during the exposed time at risk

-   Number of outcomes during the unexposed time at risk

-   Total exposed person-time at risk

-   Total unexposed person-time at risk

-   Incidence rate ratio (incidence rate during exposed time)/(incidence
    rate during unexposed time) -

-   95% confidence interval for the incidence rate ratio

-   The log of the incidence rate ratio - The standard error of the log
    incidence rate ratio

Each person's exposure start date is taken as the index date or *Time
0*. The unexposed risk window is defined prior to Time 0 and represents
a duration of time when the person was not exposed but could have
experienced the outcome. The exposed risk window is defined as a period
of time after the Time 0 and represents a duration of time when the
person was exposed and could have experienced the outcome. Both of these
time windows must be contained within a continuous period of
observation. The details about when the risk windows start and end can
be adjusted to meet the analysis specifications.

The time between the start of the observation period and Time 0 is
called the washout period and a minimum allowed washout period can be
set when defining the analysis. Similarly the time between Time 0 and
the observation period end date is the followup period. A minimum
followup period can also be set.

A common type of exposure is exposure to a drug but an exposure could be
any set of characteristics that are captured in your data. We will look
at a few different ways to define exposures.

# Tables used in the analysis

There are two primary tables needed for the self controlled cohort
analysis along with a few supporting tables that are part of the OMOP
Common Data Model.

<center>**Exposure Table**</center>

+--------------------+----------------+
| Field              | Data type      |
+====================+================+
| person_id          | Integer        |
+--------------------+----------------+
| e                  | Integer        |
| xposure_concept_id |                |
+--------------------+----------------+
| e                  | Date           |
| xposure_start_date |                |
+--------------------+----------------+
| exposure_end_date  | Date           |
+--------------------+----------------+

<center>**Outcome Table**</center>

+--------------------+----------------+
| Field              | Data type      |
+====================+================+
| person_id          | Integer        |
+--------------------+----------------+
| outcome_concept_id | Integer        |
+--------------------+----------------+
| outcome_start_date | Date           |
+--------------------+----------------+

These tables can be created manually or standard CDM tables can be used.
For example by default the drug_era is used as the exposure_table and
the condition_era table is used as the outcome_table. Every
exposure-outcome combination in these tables will be included in the
analysis unless otherwise specified. The additional CDM tables that are
required for this analysis are `observation_period`, necessary for
observation start and end dates, and `person`, necessary for year of
birth.

# A first example

The SelfControlledCohort package makes it easy to calculate the
association between every drug and every condition in a CDM database.
The Eunomia package provides a mini CDM that runs entirely within R that
we can use for examples.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(SelfControlledCohort)
library(Eunomia)

connectionDetails <- Eunomia::getEunomiaConnectionDetails()

result <- runSelfControlledCohort(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "main",
  exposureIds = '', # include all drugs as exposures
  outcomeIds = '' # include all conditions as outcomes
)
```

```{r, message=F}
library(dplyr)
result$estimates %>% 
  arrange(desc(irr)) %>% 
  head()
```

The result of our analysis is a dataframe with one row per
exposure-outcome pair along with all the relevant statistics. Let's
interpret the results for amoxicillin exposure (concept ID 1713332) and
the outcome of Chronic sinusitis (concept ID 257012)

```{r}
example <- result$estimates %>% 
  filter(exposureId == 1713332, outcomeId == 257012) 

example %>% 
  tidyr::gather() %>% 
  mutate(value = format(round(value,1), scientific = F)) %>% 
  rename(column = key) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = c("lr"))
```

We can see that `r example$numPersons` were exposed to amoxicillin. When
we add up all the time before the exposure we get
`r example$timeAtRiskUnexposed` person-years. Similarly when we add up
all the time after the exposure, the "Exposed time at risk", we get
`r example$timeAtRiskExposed` person-years.

The incidence of Chronic sinusitis during the "Unexposed time at risk"
is

$$
\frac{224 \ \ events}{45796.0 \ \ person \ years} =  0.00489
$$

The incidence of Chronic sinusitis during the "Exposed time at risk" is

$$
\frac{65 \ \ events}{277.4 \ \ person \ years} =  0.234
$$

The incidence rate ratio is \$ \frac{234}{0.00489} = 47.9\$ with a 95%
confidence interval of $[35.8, 63.4]$ See
`vignette("rateratio.test", package = "rateratio.test")` for method
details.

# Custom exposure-outcome pairs

In addition to using all drugs as exposures and all conditions as
outcomes we can come up with much more specific definitions of exposures
and outcomes using cohorts. A cohort is a set of persons who satisfy one
or more inclusion criteria for a duration of time. We can define cohorts
using Atlas or by writing SQL code. If we use Atlas then the cohort will
be stored in the Atlas "results" schema associated with your CDM
database. If you want to write SQL then you will need write access to a
schema in your CDM database.

We will simulate using cohorts created in Atlas by using the pre-built
cohorts in Eunomia.

```{r, include=FALSE}
Eunomia::createCohorts(connectionDetails)
```

Suppose we are interested in the exposure of NSAID (cohort \#4) and the
outcome of GiBleed (cohort \#3). Even though this is a drug-condition
pair these cohorts could be defined using combinations of data elements
from any domain.

```{r, include=FALSE}

result <- runSelfControlledCohort(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "main",
  exposureIds = c(1,4), # The NSAIDs cohort #4 and the Celecoxib cohort #1
  outcomeIds = 3, # The GiBleed cohort #3
  exposureTable = "cohort",
  outcomeTable = "cohort",
)
```

```{r}
result$estimates %>% 
  filter(exposureId == 4, outcomeId == 3) %>% 
  tidyr::gather() %>% 
  mutate(value = format(round(value,1), scientific = F)) %>% 
  rename(column = key) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = c("lr"))
```

In this case the risk of being in the GI Bleed cohort before entering
the exposure cohort is zero which means our rate ratio is infinite.


Even though this example uses a drug-condition pair for the exposure and
the outcome, it demonstrates how we can use any cohorts created in Atlas
as exposures and outcomes in a self controlled cohort study.

Let's demonstrate custom exposure outcome pairs using SQL by asking "Do
patients tend to get more measurements in the year after a condition
diagnosis than the year before?"

```{r}
con <- DatabaseConnector::connect(connectionDetails)
```

```{sql connection=con}
-- create outcome table
create table measurement_cohort as 
select 
  person_id as subject_id,
  1 as cohort_definition_id, -- treat any measurement as the same outcome
  measurement_date as cohort_start_date,
  measurement_date as cohort_end_date
from measurement
```

```{sql connection=con}
-- create exposure table
create table condition_cohort as 
select 
  person_id as subject_id,
  2 as cohort_definition_id, -- treat any condition as the same exposure
  condition_start_date as cohort_start_date,
  condition_end_date as cohort_end_date
from condition_occurrence
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
result <- runSelfControlledCohort(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "main",
  exposureIds = '', # use all rows in exposure table
  outcomeIds = '', # use all rows in outcome table
  exposureDatabaseSchema = "main",
  exposureTable = "condition_cohort",
  outcomeDatabaseSchema = "main",
  outcomeTable = "measurement_cohort",
  riskWindowStartExposed = 1,
  riskWindowEndExposed = 365,
  riskWindowEndUnexposed = -1,
  riskWindowStartUnexposed = -365,
)
```

Using the `riskWindow` arguments we can set the time at risk to one year
before and one year after each condition exposure.

```{r}
result$estimates %>% 
  tidyr::gather() %>% 
  mutate(value = format(round(value,1), scientific = F)) %>% 
  rename(column = key) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = c("lr"))
```

Indeed it does appear that in Eunomia patients tend to get more tests
after a diagnosis than before.


# Running multiple analyses

The SelfControlledCohort package supports performing multiple analyses at once 
and provides functions to specify the details of each analysis to be performed.


Start by creating an sccAnalysis object for each analysis type to be performed.
We will create one analysis that uses 30 day exposure windows and another with
365 day exposure windows.


```{r}
	
sccArgs1 <- createRunSelfControlledCohortArgs(firstExposureOnly = TRUE,
                                              firstOutcomeOnly = TRUE,
                                              minAge = "",
                                              maxAge = "",
                                              studyStartDate = "",
                                              studyEndDate = "",
                                              addLengthOfExposureExposed = TRUE,
                                              riskWindowStartExposed = 1,
                                              riskWindowEndExposed = 30,
                                              addLengthOfExposureUnexposed = TRUE,
                                              riskWindowEndUnexposed = -1,
                                              riskWindowStartUnexposed = -30,
                                              hasFullTimeAtRisk = FALSE,
                                              washoutPeriod = 0,
                                              followupPeriod = 0)

sccArgs2 <- createRunSelfControlledCohortArgs(firstExposureOnly = TRUE,
                                              firstOutcomeOnly = TRUE,
                                              minAge = "",
                                              maxAge = "",
                                              studyStartDate = "",
                                              studyEndDate = "",
                                              addLengthOfExposureExposed = TRUE,
                                              riskWindowStartExposed = 1,
                                              riskWindowEndExposed = 365,
                                              addLengthOfExposureUnexposed = TRUE,
                                              riskWindowEndUnexposed = -1,
                                              riskWindowStartUnexposed = -365,
                                              hasFullTimeAtRisk = FALSE,
                                              washoutPeriod = 0,
                                              followupPeriod = 0)

sccAnalysis1 <- createSccAnalysis(analysisId = 1,
                              description = "30 day risk windows",
                              exposureType = NULL, # What are the valid values for this argument?
                              outcomeType = NULL,
                              runSelfControlledCohortArgs = sccArgs1)


sccAnalysis2 <- createSccAnalysis(analysisId = 2,
                              description = "365 day risk windows",
                              exposureType = NULL,
                              outcomeType = NULL,
                              runSelfControlledCohortArgs = sccArgs1)

sccAnalysisList <- list(sccAnalysis1, sccAnalysis2)

```


Then create a list with all exposure outcome pairs to be analyzed. These can 
be concept IDs if you are using the condition_occurrence and drug_era tables or
cohort IDs if you are using a cohort table for exposures and outcomes. 


```{r}

exposureOutcomeList <- list(createExposureOutcome(exposureId = 4, outcomeId = 3),
                            createExposureOutcome(exposureId = 1, outcomeId = 3))
  
```


The total number of rate ratios will be `length(sccAnalysisList) * length(exposureOutcomesList)`
since every analysis will be executed for every exposure-outcome pair.

```{r}
	
results <- runSccAnalyses(connectionDetails,
                          cdmDatabaseSchema = "main",
                          exposureTable = "cohort",
                          outcomeTable = "cohort",
                          outputFolder = "./SelfControlledCohortOutput",
                          sccAnalysisList = sccAnalysisList,
                          exposureOutcomeList = exposureOutcomeList,
                          analysisThreads = 1,
                          computeThreads = 1)


summarizeAnalyses(results, "./SelfControlledCohortOutput")
```


Analysis result objects are saved to the output folder and are aggregated by
the `summarizeAnalyses` function which returns a results dataframe with one row
for each result.


# Correcting bias with EmpiricalCalibration

Effect estimates generated from observational data likely suffer from significant
systematic bias. For example, this study design has the flaw that an exposure may
look protective due to confounding by indication where patients are commonly exposed
to a medication that is used to treat a comorbidity. For this reason, the
`SelfControlledCohort` is often used with the
[`EmpiricalCalibration`](https://github.com/OHDSI/EmpiricalCalibration) package
to adjust effect estimates using negative control cohorts.

See [`MethodEvaulation`](https://github.com/OHDSI/MethodEvaulation) For more details
on evaluating algorithms for population-level effect estimation in observational
studies.
