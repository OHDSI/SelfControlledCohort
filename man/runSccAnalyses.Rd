\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An R object of type \code{connectionDetails} created using the
function \code{createConnectionDetails} in the
\code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that contains the OMOP CDM instance.
Requires read permissions to this database. On SQL Server, this
should specifiy both the database and the schema, so for example
'cdm_instance.dbo'.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{For Oracle only: the name of the database schema where you want all
temporary tables to be managed. Requires create/insert permissions
to this database.}

\item{exposureDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where the
exposure data used to define the exposure cohorts is available. If
exposureTable = DRUG_ERA, exposureDatabaseSchema is not used by
assumed to be cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions to this
database.}

\item{exposureTable}{The tablename that contains the exposure cohorts.  If exposureTable
<> DRUG_ERA, then expectation is exposureTable has format of COHORT
table: COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE,
COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{outcomeDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where the data
used to define the outcome cohorts is available. If exposureTable =
CONDITION_ERA, exposureDatabaseSchema is not used by assumed to be
cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions to this database.}

\item{outcomeTable}{The tablename that contains the outcome cohorts.  If outcomeTable <>
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, then expectation is outcomeTable has format of
COHORT table: COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE,
COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{cdmVersion}{Define the OMOP CDM version used: currently support "4" and
"5".}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of the folder where all the outputs will written to.}

\item{sccAnalysisList}{A list of objects of type \code{sccAnalysis} as created using the
\code{\link{createSccAnalysis}} function.}

\item{exposureOutcomeList}{A list of objects of type \code{exposureOutcome} as created using
the \code{\link{createExposureOutcome}} function.}

\item{analysisTreads}{The number of parallel threads to use to execute the analyses.}

\description{
Run a list of analyses
}
\details{
Run a list of analyses for the drug-comparator-outcomes of interest. This function will run all
specified analyses against all hypotheses of interest, meaning that the total number of outcome
models is `length(cmAnalysisList) * length(drugComparatorOutcomesList)` (if all analyses specify an
outcome model should be fitted). When you provide several analyses it will determine whether any of
the analyses have anything in common, and will take advantage of this fact. For example, if we
specify several analyses that only differ in the way the outcome model is fitted, then this
function will extract the data and fit the propensity model only once, and re-use this in all the
analysis.
