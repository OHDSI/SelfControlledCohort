\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An R object of type \code{connectionDetails} created using
the function \code{createConnectionDetails} in the
\code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Name of database schema that contains the OMOP CDM and
vocabulary.}

\item{tempEmulationSchema}{Some database platforms like Oracle and Impala do not truly support temp tables. To emulate temp
tables, provide a schema with write privileges where temp tables can be created.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{For Oracle only: the name of the database schema where you
want all temporary tables to be managed. Requires
create/insert permissions to this database.}

\item{exposureDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where
the exposure data used to define the exposure cohorts is
available. If exposureTable = DRUG_ERA,
exposureDatabaseSchema is not used by assumed to be
cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions to this database.}

\item{exposureTable}{The tablename that contains the exposure cohorts.  If
exposureTable <> DRUG_ERA, then expectation is exposureTable
has format of COHORT table: cohort_concept_id, SUBJECT_ID,
COHORT_START_DATE, COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{outcomeDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where
the data used to define the outcome cohorts is available. If
exposureTable = CONDITION_ERA, exposureDatabaseSchema is not
used by assumed to be cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions
to this database.}

\item{outcomeTable}{The tablename that contains the outcome cohorts.  If
outcomeTable <> CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, then expectation is
outcomeTable has format of COHORT table:
COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE,
COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{cdmVersion}{Define the OMOP CDM version used: currently support "4" and
"5".}

\item{analysisThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use to execute the analyses.}

\item{computeThreads}{Number of parallel threads for computing IRRs with exact
confidence intervals.}

\description{
Run a list of analyses
}
\details{
Run a list of analyses for the drug-comparator-outcomes of interest. This function will run all
specified analyses against all hypotheses of interest, meaning that the total number of outcome
models is `length(cmAnalysisList) * length(drugComparatorOutcomesList)`.
